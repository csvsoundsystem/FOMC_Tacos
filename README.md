A csv soundsystem data gastronomification experiment

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets interest rates for the entire economy.

Their statements announcing  interest rate policy is the single most important and highly-anticipated and written-about event each time it happens. Everyone writes about it on page A1 of the newspaper:

Unfortunately, it is written in economic argot that is hard for orginary people to understand, except for reporters and analysts who divine these important statementsâ€™ meaning for the lay reader.

Our objective: visualize the FOMC statements by turning them into food - a data gastronomification experiment.
