A csv soundsystem data gastronomification experiment

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets interest rates for the entire economy.

Their statements announcing  interest rate policy is the single most important and highly-anticipated and written-about event each time it happens. Everyone writes about it on page A1 of the newspaper:

Unfortunately, it is written in economic argot that is hard for orginary people to understand, except for reporters and analysts who divine these important statementsâ€™ meaning for the lay reader.

Our objective: visualize the FOMC statements by turning them into food - a data gastronomification experiment.

## <a id="sourcedata">What are FOMC Statements?</a>

The Federal Open market Committee (FOMC) meets about six times a year to decide interest rates and - more recently - the fate of bond purchase programs. 

The statement outlining their decision is called the FOMC statement. It is the single most important and market-moving statement published by the Fed.
