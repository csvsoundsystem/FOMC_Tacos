The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets interest rates for the entire economy.

Their statement announcing their interest rate decision is the single most important and highly-anticipated and written-about event each time it happens. Everyone writes about it on page A1 of the newspaper:

Unfortunately, it is written in economic gibberish that is hard for people to understand, except for Fed reporters who divine these important statementsâ€™ meaning for the lay reader.

Our objective: visualize the FOMC statements by turning them into tacos, and make them easily understandable to anyone.
